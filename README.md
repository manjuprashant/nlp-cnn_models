# Educational NLP with RNN, LSTM, and GRU

This project demonstrates how to use various Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures to solve two key NLP tasks:
1. **Educational Text Classification** — Categorize short educational sentences into subjects (Math, Science, History).
2. **Next Word Generation** — Predict the next words in a sentence using trained language models.

## 🧠 Models Used

- 🔁 **SimpleRNN**
- 🧠 **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
- ⚡ **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**

Each model is implemented using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on a small educational corpus.
